## 1.Overview

   JIntellitype is an API for interacting with Microsoft Intellitype keyboard commands as well as registering for Global Hotkeys in your application.
   The API is a Java JNI library that uses a DLL to do all the communication with Windows.
   This library ONLY works on Windows.

   Have you ever wanted to have CTRL+SHIFT+G maximize your Swing application on the desktop even if that application did not have focus?
   Now you can by registering a Windows Hotkey combination your application will be alerted when the combination you select is pressed anywhere in Windows.

   Have you ever wanted to react to those special Play, Pause, Stop keys on some Microsoft and Logitech keyboards?
   Even some laptops now have those special keys built in and if you want your application to "listen" for them, now you
   can!

## 2.Features
* Can register global hotkey combinations in Windows.

* Application is notified even if it does not have focus.

* Can react to those Play, Pause, Stop, Next, Forward Media keys like Winamp.

* Very little code, easy to use API.

* Examples included in JIntellitypeTester.java.

## 3.Installation

FOR USERS:

 The 32/64 bit dlls get extracted automatically.

FOR DEVELOPERS:

* To build you need [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) or higher installed from Apache.
  Just run "mvn package" from the directory where the pom.xml is located to build the project.

* To build the C++ code you need Visual Studio C++.


## 4.Quick Usage

```java
       // Create JIntellitype
       ...
        JIntellitype.getInstance().addHotKeyListener(new HotKeyListener() {...);
        JIntellitype.getInstance().addIntellitypeListener(new IntellitypeListener() {...);
       ...

        // Assign global hotkeys to Windows+A and ALT+SHIFT+B
        JIntellitype.getInstance().registerHotKey(1, JIntellitype.MOD_WIN, (int)'A');
        JIntellitype.getInstance().registerHotKey(2, JIntellitype.MOD_ALT + JIntellitype.MOD_SHIFT, (int)'B');

        // listen for hotkey
        public void onHotKey(int aIdentifier) {
           if (aIdentifier == 1)
             System.out.println("WINDOWS+A hotkey pressed");
           }
        }

        // listen for intellitype play/pause command
        public void onIntellitype(int aCommand) {
            switch (aCommand) {
                case JIntellitype.APPCOMMAND_MEDIA_PLAY_PAUSE:
                    System.out.println("Play/Pause message received " + Integer.toString(aCommand));
                break;
                default:
                    System.out.println("Undefined INTELLITYPE message caught " + Integer.toString(aCommand));
                break;
            }
        }

       // Termination
       ...
       JIntellitype.getInstance().cleanUp();
       System.exit(0);
```
